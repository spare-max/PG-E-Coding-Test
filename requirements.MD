# MRAD Node.js Coding Challenge

## You need to create an AWS lambda function to do the following:
## Create a RESTful API which executes the following steps for every request
    a. Pull data from this url:
    b. Make some changes to the output from the url above:
        1. Remove rental_methods and rental_uris from the output.
        2. Rename: external_id, station_id, and legacy_id into externalId, stationId, and
        legacyId.
        3. Return the data when the capacity is less than 12.
    c. Convert your JSON output into CSV.
    d. Write your output into a filesystem as a .csv file.
    e. Upload your file to S3. (overwrite or create a new file)

## Requirements
    * Use Hapi (node framework).
    * Use async/await.
    * Add a unit-test for the API call.
    * Use whatever node packages you like but donâ€™t install a 3rd party databases,
    caching, or other server apps.
    * Optimize the app as best as possible for performance and assume your app will run
    in a multiprocessor or multicore environment.
    * Setup your app to run both locally and on AWS. This means that the Lambda created
    on AWS, will need to be somehow triggered when running your project locally. You
    may have to store the logic in your AWS Lambda in a local file so it can be triggered.
    You are free to use any means possible.

## Really Nice To Have (bonus):
    * API request would have an API token and handle the case where this is missing.
    * Containerize your app so it can be deployed using Docker.
    * Provide API gateway url to trigger your lambda.
    * Anything to make your project stand out!
    
## Submission
    Provide the source code to your project through a file or code repository.
    Please include a README in the project that has information on how to run your project and
    any additional details.
